I have make Spotify-clone using #html, #css and #javascript . I have taken the help of youtube to make this., Hope you all see and like my project. There is only code that you can see What you have to by your own is to make a folder and name it as "Cover" then insert the cover of the songs respectively and then make one more folder name it as "Songs" and then insert the songs in the Song folder.
